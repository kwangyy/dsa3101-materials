# node.py

Hi there! We are node.py, group 4. Our group name is inspired by node.js and our knowledge graph. 

There are two parts to our project:
1. Backend: A REST API built with FastAPI that allows users to process text data, generate ontologies, and manage a knowledge graph using Neo4j.
2. Frontend: A React application that interacts with the backend API to process text data, generate ontologies, and manage a knowledge graph using Neo4j.

To run the backend, please refer to the README.md in the backend folder.

To run the frontend, please refer to the README.md in the dsa3101-ui folder.

The wiki is also updated with the latest information of the project.

Thank you for reading this short README.md!
